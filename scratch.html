       <h1>The Beauty of Sports!</h1> <br>
    <h2>I have always loved sports, I find them to be a great way to learn teamwork and stay in good shape. In addition to playing them, I love to watch and follow sports. I believe that sports can truly bring people together in a shared passion.</h2> <br>

    <h3>Because of my great love of sports, I have decided to make a YouTube channel and post sports content on it. So far my channel only has 3 videos and they are all about college football, I do plan to make one about college basketball soon. Below you will find my most popular video which is about Ashton Jeanty, a player for Boise State. Ashton has had one of the greatest seasons in college football as a running back, undeniably the greatest season in Boise State history</h3>
